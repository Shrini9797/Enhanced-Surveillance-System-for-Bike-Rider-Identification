# Enhanced Surveillance System for Bike Rider Identification

ABSTRCAT: 
Road accidents are one of the major causes of human deaths. Among the different types of road accidents, motorcycle accidents are common and cause severe injuries. The helmet is the motorcyclistâ€™s main protection.in current situation, we come across various problems in traffic regulations in India which can be solved with different ideas. Riding motorcycle without wearing helmet is a traffic violation which has resulted in increase in number of accidents and deaths in India. As a solution to this, it is highly desirable for bike-riders to use helmet. Observing the usefulness of helmet, Governments have made it punishable offense to ride a bike without helmet and have adopted manual strategies to catch the violators which has limitations of speed. Using video surveillance of the street, the proposed approach detects if the bike rider is wearing a helmet automatically without manual help. If a bike rider is detected not wearing a helmet, the number plate of the vehicle read and noted.
E-challan will also be generated with offender details. A database will be generated with records to identify every offender accurately. The system implements pure machine learning in order to identify every type of helmet that it comes across with minimum computation cost.
